## Level Design

In this game, you will run across floating islands, hide from enemies (and their bombs), collect coins and gems, and finally arrive at the destination.

A screeshot of the game:

### Collectibles

#### Coin

![Coin](https://github.com/yu-yiming/UEField/blob/main/LevelDesign/coin.jpg)

Collect coin to earn more score. They are arranged mostly on the main route of the game.

#### Gem

These are more precious than coins. Try find them in secret places!

#### Jump Boost

You can jump higher in a short period of time after obtaining this. The amount of boost may differ.

#### Health Pack

Get one HP back. I didn't put many of this in the level; take care.

#### Key

![Key](https://github.com/yu-yiming/UEField/blob/main/LevelDesign/Key.jpg)

The key to the final gate. I hide it in a rather secret place.

### Enemies

#### The Pursuer

![Pursuer](https://github.com/yu-yiming/UEField/blob/main/LevelDesign/Pursuer.jpg)

An enemy that patrol in a specific area, but chase after the player once we get close. If a pursuer get you, you will lose one HP.

#### The Mortar

![Mortar](https://github.com/yu-yiming/UEField/blob/main/LevelDesign/Mortar.jpg)

A projectile launcher that is fixed at a location. The balls it throws are on fire and will explode soon after getting still on the ground. The players will be knocked back and lose HP based on the distance between the explosion center and them. Even before the explosion, the burning ball is dangerous and will cause damage to the players on any contact.

#### The Bomber

![Bomber](https://github.com/yu-yiming/UEField/blob/main/LevelDesign/Bomber.jpg)

These are the mysterious enemies that disappear when players get close, leaving a small box and smoke distracting you. The box will explode soon so either kick it away (since it's really light) or get away from it, or you will get a lot of damage.


### Other Information

#### Checkpoint

It will be frustrating if you almost make it to the end, but accidentally fall from the floating islands and respawn at the beginning. That's why I placed some checkpoints throughout the level. Step on it and this place will be recorded. Next time you die, you will be respawned right here.

#### Secret Places

The coins do a good job to guide you through the destination, but to those who wants to collect all gems: pay more attention to your back, above, and below.
