Bombs are very helpful; they get rid of all troubles.

### Enemies

Avoid them, or defeat them! They cannot move but they block your way.


### Basic Gameplay

#### Moving

Move the mouse to adjust your position and avoid hitting the walls and enemies. If you collide on them, your health will decrease.

#### Firing Projectiles

Use mouse left button to shoot a projectile forward. An enemy will disappear if it's hit, and you gain 5 points from this.

#### Throwing Bombs

Boom! All existing enemies and walls will vanish; that's a lot of damage!


### Other Tips

Your speed as well as the spinning speed of the walls will increase as the game progress!
